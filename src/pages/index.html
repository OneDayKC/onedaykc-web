    <p>#OneDayKC is a 12 hour innovation workshop and competition for college students and juniors/seniors in high school, held on Friday, April 1st, 2016. The event will take place at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation Conference Center from 8:00am to 5:00pm, with a public judging ceremony at Rockhurst University's Arrupe Hall beginning at 6:30pm.</p>
    <p>With recent technological and infrastructural developments in Kansas City, like Cisco’s Smart City initiative, the Streetcar, and rapidly-expanding Google Fiber, Kansas City is uniquely poised to become an even more amazing place to live and work in the next ten years. There is an incredible potential to design sustainable communities, leverage smart devices through the Internet of Everything, and create an efficient, flourishing city for 2025 and beyond &mdash; and for the second year in a row, we’re bringing together the top young minds from the region to make it happen.</p>
    <p>Through the workshop, students will be introduced to civic challenges in a variety of fields. We’ve organized a team of mentors who are rockstars in technology, entrepreneurship, service design, hardware, architecture, urban planning, education, and sustainable thinking. With a wealth of expertise at their disposal, our teams of students will create big-picture solutions through the power of a connected city and Lean methods, "failing fast" to validate their solutions and assumptions. Participants will tackle complex problems, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sustainability & Energy</li>
      <li>Transit & Traffic</li>
      <li>Municipal Services</li>
      <li>Health & Well-being</li>
      <li>Education & Workforce Development</li>
      <li>Culture, Recreation, and Public Spaces</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Students' ideas will be transformed into business models and prototypes and then pitched to a panel of judges.</p>
    <p>This event is a collaborative effort between William Jewell College, Rockhurst University, and the University of Missouri - Kansas City’s Regnier Institute. The event is co-directed by Bradley Dice (WJC), Trevor Nicks (WJC), Macy Tush (WJC), Ben Shinogle (WJC), Alex Holden (WJC), Michael Brummett (RU), Mike Frazzetta (RU), and Tin Ho (UMKC), with mentorship from professors Landon Young (WJC), Risa Stein (RU), and Ben Williams (UMKC). Students from across the Midwest are encouraged to join! Are you a student innovator, entrepreneur, problem solver, engineer, designer, tech enthusiast, or are you passionate about civic development and contributing to a better world? This workshop is meant for you.</p>
